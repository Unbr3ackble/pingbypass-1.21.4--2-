  PingBypass
</h1>

:warning: **Warning**  
This Version of PingBypass does not have any actual PingBypass functionality yet.
I am releasing it because I use it as a base to run [Phobot](https://github.com/3arthqu4ke/Phobot).
Since Phobot is my last mc project I do not think I am going to maintain this for long.
For a 1.12.2 PingBypass see [3arthh4ck](https://github.com/3arthqu4ke/3arthh4ck).

Credits go to 3arthqu4ke for providing the original src. This is just a port to 1.21.4 of the client wich is still a work-in-progress and does not work yet. When the port will work, i will also create a port of the phobot plugin. Do not try to contact me for help with the client if it doesnt work, bc i wont answer. I will try to keep this up=to-date with the last version future client is avaible (wich for now its  2.18 on mc 1.21.4).
